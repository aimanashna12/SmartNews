This project has a separate frontend and backend folder.
To run this, clone it into your local device and create a .env file in the backend folder with content "NEWS_API_KEY=7b0f998c6aa14058a6b712f1e607ef0d"
Then you can run the backend (node server.js)
Similarly you can run the frontend by entering npm run start in your device.
